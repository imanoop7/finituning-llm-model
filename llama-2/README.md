# Fine-Tuning LLM Model

Welcome to the **Fine-Tuning LLM Model** repository! In this project, we explore the process of fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) to improve their performance on specific tasks or domains. Whether you're working on sentiment analysis, chatbots, summarization, or any other NLP task, fine-tuning can enhance your model's accuracy and context-specific results.

## Repository Structure

- `llama-2/llama2_finetuning_lora.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook demonstrating fine-tuning techniques  LORA.
- `llama-factory/llama_factory.ipynb`: Notebook showcasing how to create a fine-tuned LLM using the Llama Factory approach.
- `using-lora/finituning_llama.ipynb`: Example notebook illustrating fine-tuning using LORA approach.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Explore the provided Jupyter notebooks to understand different fine-tuning methods.
3. Customize the notebooks for your specific use case by adapting the code and datasets.

## Fine-Tuning Applications

Fine-tuning LLMs can be applied to various tasks:
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Improve accuracy in classifying sentiment (positive/negative/neutral).
- **Chatbots**: Create context-aware chatbots that understand domain-specific language.
- **Summarization**: Fine-tune for better content summarization.
- **Many More**

## Contributing

Feel free to contribute by adding more fine-tuning examples, sharing insights, or suggesting improvements. Let's make language models even smarter together!

Happy fine-tuning! ðŸš€
